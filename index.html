              I started as a .Net developer for a couple years, and after getting my MBA started with a small start-up biotech company.  After giving the start-up life a try for a couple years, I unfortunately had to move on and look a position with GlowTouch Technologies as a project manager, managing a team of off-shore developers.

              I got my Bachelors of Science in Business Administration from UofL in 2006 through the Computer Information Systems (CIS) path.  After working as a programmer for 2 years, I started my MBA at Indiana University Southeast, graduating in 2010.

              I currently work as a project manager.  My role is to lead a team of software developers located in Mangalore, India, including PHP and Java developers, front-end designers, QA testers, and infrastructure support personnel.  I manage two separate software products, both intended for the education industry.  I work directly with GlowTouch management to determine requirements, recommend features and changes, plan development sprints and create roadmaps for future development.  I also help with making budget decisions, client demos, market research, and much more.

              After getting my MBA, I took a job with a biotech startup that had an online repository of genetic research information for researchs to safely upload, store, and share their data.  I wore a lot of hats, including researching updates to the system, working with our contractors, managing budgets, helpign with marketing and sales, support, and much more.  As sometimes happens with start-ups, I had to move on, but I greatly enjoyed my time there and learned a great deal about the entire life of a business.

              My first job out of college was working as a .Net developer.  I worked on multiple applications, including an ecommerce site, a non-profit grant institution, and an enterprise-level Health Information System.  I perpetually had to learn new development and database skills, as well as how to work with clients, analyze requirements, learn new skills, and solve complex development problems.

                Muir Woods.  The size of the redwoods is humbling and the canopy is so far above that each tree casts a monstrous shadow on everything around it.

                Home of the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, and many other ancient sites.  Agra was a wonderful place to travel around all day - whether on foot or by auto-rickshaw.

                Rocky Mountain National Park.  One of the more gorgeous sites I've seen.  Hiking around in the high altitude proved to be quite the challenge while climbing the steep hills.

                Delhi was host to many ancient temples, ruins, and other fascinating sites.  I spent a day just visitng ancient Hindu and Muslim sites that were built thousands of years ago.
